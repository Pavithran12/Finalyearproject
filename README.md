																					SMART  E-TICKET IN BUS USING QR CODE
OBJECTIVE

The Objective of the application is to develop a mobile application to digitalize the ticketing process in public transportation organization by generating a QR code. The QR contains the information of the source and destination. It also provides gps facility for the users to locate their bus. It also uses the e-wallet for the payment process.
		 
		 
		 
PROBLEM STATEMENT

Digitalize the process of ticket vending in the local bus transport system using mobile application. Track and locate the bus. Automated entry of ticket details


ABSTRACT

The project allows the user to pay using the mobile application. e-Ticket is generated in the form of qr Code. The Payment is done through the wallet in the system. The use of paper and cash in the existing system is completely stopped. Data generated in large number, in the event of ticket vending which is used for analysis of the bus route. The tracking system is enabled to locate the bus. The whole system works in a centralized datacenter sharing information from different data sources



Future Enhancement

This project contributes in providing effective solutions to current transportation system. The mobile phones which are commonly used in everydays life is brought into the system. The ticketing is done with ease through the app. The generated ticket will be in the form of qr code.  The ticket information will allow us to to know better about the usage of a particular route and the organization using the system will be able to understand implement bus based upon the needs. That will profit the organization in many ways.
The future enhancement of this system will not need a employee to scan the tickets which will be replaced by a scanner that is connected to the automatic doors of the bus.  There will be also image processing which would enable to verify that the scanned data matches with the number of passengers in the bus.
The smart system enables a better management.


Modules

Qr code generation module 
Database connection modules
Scanner module 
Payment module


Qr code generation module 
	The QR code is generated based on the source and destination information provided by the user. It is an bitmap image of static size 200*200.
Database connection modules
   The databse is connected with API and the information is  passed to the databse from anddroid.
Scanner module 
  The scanner module scans the generated QR and shows the source, destination and number of ticket information.
